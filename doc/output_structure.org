#+TITLE: Output data structure
#+AUTHOR: Mark Huberty

* Baseline data
- In the primary =./data/= directory
- =candidates.csv=: candidate data; =state_dist= is the 4-character
  state:district code 
- =districts.csv= district-level data, including incumbent party and
  the NYT district partisan rating

* Prediction data
- In the =./predictions/= directory
- =./predictions/vote_share= holds the vote share
  prediction. =continuous.prediction.master.csv= provides the master
  file with all predictions by date. Fieldnames are defined as:
  - =state_district=: (character) the 4-character state-district code
  - =dem_vote_share=: (float) the predicted Democratic vote share
  - =prediction.date=: (character) the prediction date, formatted YYYY-MM-DD
- =./predictions/win_loss= holds the equivalent win/loss data. The
  master file is titled =binary.prediction.master.csv'. Fieldnames are
  defined as:
  - =state_district=: (character) the 4-character state-district code
  - =prob.d.win=: (float) the predicted Democratic win probability
  - =binary.d.win=: (integer) the 1/0 Democratic win outcome
  - =prediction.date=: (character) the date of the prediction, formatted YYYY-MM-DD

Both directories also contain time-stamped files for recordkeeping
purposes. But the =master= files should be read for display purposes.

* Topic model data
- In the =./data/topic_models/= directory
- The file =district.topic.unigrams.master.csv= holds the 1-gram based
  topic model output at the district level. Fieldnames are defined as:
  - =state_dist=: (character) the 4-character state-district index
  - =topic.num=: (integer) the integer value of the topic assigned to that district
  - =topic.label=: (character) the top 10 words assigned to that topic,
    pipe-separated. As in =this|is|a|topic|=, etc.
  - =state=: the state name
  - =district=: (integer) the Congressional district
  - =incumbent_party=: (character) the incumbent party in the district. One of
    *D* or *R*. Note that
    the district can have an incumbent party even if there's no
    incumbent candidate
  - =rating=: (character) the NYT partisan rating for the district
  - =date=: (character) the date of the topic model construction

Note that the number of topics can change on a day-to-day basis. We
determine the topics from the data. As of 1 Sept 2012, the topic count
is bounded in the 20-40 range.
